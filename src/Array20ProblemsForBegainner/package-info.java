here are 20 array-based questions with varying difficulty levels:

1.Write a program to print the elements of an array in reverse order.
2.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the sum of all the even numbers in the array.
3.Write a program to find the largest element in an array.
4.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the sum of all the elements in the array.
5.Write a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
6.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the median of the array.
7.Write a program to remove all the negative elements from an array.
8.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the product of all the elements in the array.
9.Write a program to reverse the order of elements in an array in groups of k.
10.Given two arrays of equal length, write a program to find the dot product of the arrays.
11.Write a program to find the smallest and largest elements in an unsorted array.
12.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the second largest element in the array.
13.Write a program to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.
14.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the elements that appear more than once in the array.
15.Write a program to find the elements that appear exactly once in an array.
16.Given two sorted arrays, write a program to merge them into a single sorted array.
17.Write a program to remove duplicates from an array.
18.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
19.Write a program to find the pair of elements in an array whose sum is closest to zero.
20.Given an array of integers, write a program to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
These questions cover a variety of array-related topics and can be useful for interview preparation or practicing coding skills.
